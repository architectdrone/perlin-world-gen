# Perlin World Generator

Perlin Noise based terrain generation using Python

# What is it?

This is a terrain generator that interprets perlin noise as terrain, and does several other nice things, producing a visually interesting display.

# Features

Some features of this world generator are:

    Shadows: Shadows add a great deal of personality to the world, as well as helping provide an intuitive sense of depth
  
    Topology: Topographical lines assist in understanding the landscape.
  
    Biomes: Precipitation patterns produce noticable coloration in the landscape.

# Dependencies

Pygame is the only dependency.

# Usage

To tinker with world generation, try adjusting the global variables at the top of the worldGen.py .
